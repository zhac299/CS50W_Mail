# CS50W Mail

This project is part of my CS50W course. In this project I created an email application which allows registered users to send and receive emails. This project was created with Django and thus contains Python but was mainly developed with JavaScript to help me develop my skills with it.

Languages Used - Python, JavaScript, CSS and Django generated SQL.
